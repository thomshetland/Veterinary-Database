Things we have to think about:
- How do we update our inventory?
    - Some supplies are consumed as units
    - While others are consumed as fractal units

  Remember quantity is how much we buy
  while units are represent the amount in which they are consumed

  Answer:
  Introduce quantity and units available,
    where supplies are consumed as units their quantity = units available
    where supplies are consumed as fractal units we divided the quantity by the fractal to obtain the units available

- Maybe we drop the supplyTypes Table
- Should we include a payment type table
